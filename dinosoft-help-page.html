Users can try refreshing the page or contacting customer 			  support for assistance. Input errors, like mistyped information, 			   can impede registration. To avoid this, users should review 				their details before submission.

<br><br>
This issue typically arises due to the clickable areas within the 9 dots menu. The menu items are designed to be activated when clicked directly, which can inadvertently lead to redirection if not clicked correctly. To mitigate this problem, we recommend the following:
<br><br>
1) <b>Click Around the 9 Dots:</b> Instead of clicking directly on the dots, try clicking between, under, above, or on the sides of the dots. This should help avoid accidental redirection.
<br><br>
2) <b>Avoid the Dots: </b>Clicking directly on the dots themselves may trigger the redirection to the specific page each dot is responsible for.
<br><br>
Please keep in mind that our development team is aware of this issue and is actively working on improving the user interface to enhance usability and prevent unintended actions.

If you continue to encounter difficulties or if there are any other questions or concerns you have, please don't hesitate to contact us. Our support team is here to assist you and ensure your experience with our service is as smooth as possible.
